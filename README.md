The entire application is based on a Flask server where HTML pages are rendered to show a little database (extracted from a CSV file) of different Cafes and their rating on WiFi connection, outlet availability, and most importantly, coffee quality.

There is also a link to add a new Cafe to the list:

A great functionality created for this part of the project is a robust validation structure. Users have to fill every field and input the correct information. There are also validators for the link and operating hours:

This project is a great exercise on several web-related and python-related technologies.
