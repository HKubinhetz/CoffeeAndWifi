# CoffeeAndWifi
A Project that rates Coffees and their Wifi Connections. Made with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and Love ❤.

The entire application is based on a Flask server where HTML pages are rendered to show a little database (extracted from a CSV file) of different Cafes and their rating on WiFi connection, outlet availability, and most importantly, coffee quality.

There is also a link to add a new Cafe to the list. A great functionality created for this part of the project is a robust validation structure. Users have to fill every field and input the correct information. 

There are also validators for the link and operating hours. It is possible to create any type of validation, simple or complex, through a python function embedded on the Flask Form.

I also changed the appearance of the error messages from red to gold to better fit the background color:

This project is a great exercise on several web-related and python-related technologies.
